Setup Instructions - Clothing Store Management System
======================================================

1. Running the Server
----------------------
The server must run on one computer. All clients connect to the same server.

Option A: Using IntelliJ IDEA (or another IDE)
a. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
b. Find the file: src/server/ServerMain.java
c. Run the file (Run -> Run 'ServerMain' or Shift+F10)
d. If everything is OK, you will see: "Server listening on port 5000"
e. Keep the window open - the server must run all the time

Option B: Using Terminal/Command Line
a. Open Terminal (Linux/Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
b. Navigate to the project directory (where src/ folder is located)
c. Compile all Java files. You can use one of these methods:
   
   Method 1 - Compile all files at once (if your system supports it):
   - Windows: javac -d out -encoding UTF-8 -sourcepath src src\server\*.java src\controller\*.java src\model\*.java src\model\managers\*.java src\model\exceptions\*.java src\storage\*.java src\gui\*.java src\gui\dialogs\*.java src\gui\tabs\*.java src\gui\windows\*.java
   - Linux/Mac: javac -d out -encoding UTF-8 -sourcepath src src/server/*.java src/controller/*.java src/model/*.java src/model/managers/*.java src/model/exceptions/*.java src/storage/*.java src/gui/*.java src/gui/dialogs/*.java src/gui/tabs/*.java src/gui/windows/*.java
   
   Method 2 - Compile recursively (simpler):
   - Find all .java files and compile them:
     Windows PowerShell: Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter *.java | ForEach-Object { javac -d out -encoding UTF-8 -sourcepath src $_.FullName }
     Linux/Mac: find src -name "*.java" -exec javac -d out -encoding UTF-8 -sourcepath src {} \;
   
   Note: Make sure the "out" folder exists. If not, create it first: mkdir out

d. Run the server:
   - java -cp out server.ServerMain
e. If everything is OK, you will see: "Server listening on port 5000"
f. Keep the terminal open - the server must run all the time


2. Running a Client
-------------------
Every user who wants to use the software needs to run the client on their computer.

Option A: Using IntelliJ IDEA (or another IDE)
a. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
b. Find the file: src/gui/LoginWindow.java
c. Run the file (Run -> Run 'LoginWindow' or Shift+F10)
d. A login window will open

Option B: Using Terminal/Command Line
a. Open Terminal (Linux/Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
b. Navigate to the project directory (where src/ folder is located)
c. If you haven't compiled yet, compile all Java files (see Server instructions in section 1)
d. Run the client:
   - java -cp out gui.LoginWindow
e. A login window will open


3. Connecting from Multiple Computers
-------------------------------------
The client.config file already exists in the project and contains the server address: 192.168.56.1

If you download the project from Git:
- The client.config file already exists
- Just run LoginWindow and the software will connect to the server automatically

If you want to change the server address:
- Open the client.config file
- Change the address after serverHost=


4. Example - Using 3 Computers
--------------------------------
Computer 1 (IP: 192.168.56.1) - The Server:
- Runs ServerMain
- Keeps the server open

Computer 2:
- Downloads the project from Git (client.config file already exists)
- Runs LoginWindow
- Connects to the server automatically

Computer 3:
- Downloads the project from Git (client.config file already exists)
- Runs LoginWindow
- Connects to the same server

All users see the same data and communicate with each other in chat!


5. Default Users
----------------
When running the server for the first time, a default user is created automatically:
- admin / admin (System Administrator)

Use this for initial login.


6. Troubleshooting
------------------
If the client cannot connect to the server:
- Make sure the server is running on computer 192.168.56.1
- Make sure the IP address in client.config is 192.168.56.1
- Make sure both computers are on the same network (WiFi or Ethernet)
- Check that port 5000 is not blocked by Firewall

If there are errors:
- Make sure all files loaded correctly
- Make sure there is a data/ folder with JSON files
- Check the console to see error messages


7. Important Notes
------------------
- The server must run all the time - if you close it, all clients disconnect
- All clients see the same data (products, customers, sales)
- Chat works between all connected users
- Every change in the system updates automatically for all users
