Setup Instructions - Clothing Store Management System
======================================================

1. Running the Server
----------------------
The server must run on one computer. All clients connect to the same server.

a. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (or another IDE)

b. Find the file: src/server/ServerMain.java

c. Run the file (Run -> Run 'ServerMain' or Shift+F10)

d. If everything is OK, you will see: "Server listening on port 5000"

e. Keep the window open - the server must run all the time


2. Running a Client
-------------------
Every user who wants to use the software needs to run the client on their computer.

a. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA

b. Find the file: src/gui/LoginWindow.java

c. Run the file (Run -> Run 'LoginWindow' or Shift+F10)

d. A login window will open


3. Connecting from Multiple Computers
-------------------------------------
The client.config file already exists in the project and contains the server address: 192.168.56.1

If you download the project from Git:
- The client.config file already exists
- Just run LoginWindow and the software will connect to the server automatically

If you want to change the server address:
- Open the client.config file
- Change the address after serverHost=


4. Example - Using 3 Computers
--------------------------------
Computer 1 (IP: 192.168.56.1) - The Server:
- Runs ServerMain
- Keeps the server open

Computer 2:
- Downloads the project from Git (client.config file already exists)
- Runs LoginWindow
- Connects to the server automatically

Computer 3:
- Downloads the project from Git (client.config file already exists)
- Runs LoginWindow
- Connects to the same server

All users see the same data and communicate with each other in chat!


5. Default Users
----------------
When running the server for the first time, a default user is created automatically:
- admin / admin (System Administrator)

Use this for initial login.


6. Troubleshooting
------------------
If the client cannot connect to the server:
- Make sure the server is running on computer 192.168.56.1
- Make sure the IP address in client.config is 192.168.56.1
- Make sure both computers are on the same network (WiFi or Ethernet)
- Check that port 5000 is not blocked by Firewall

If there are errors:
- Make sure all files loaded correctly
- Make sure there is a data/ folder with JSON files
- Check the console to see error messages


7. Important Notes
------------------
- The server must run all the time - if you close it, all clients disconnect
- All clients see the same data (products, customers, sales)
- Chat works between all connected users
- Every change in the system updates automatically for all users
